# Machine Learning Classification

## Overview
This repository contains code for a machine learning classification model. The model is trained to classify images into different categories using deep learning techniques.

## Classification Model
### Model File
- **classification_model.h5**: This file contains the trained classification model.
  - You can load this model using `model.load_model("classification_model.h5")`.

### Notes on Model Loading
- **Model Compilation**: After loading the model, you can compile it with different configurations such as weights and activations.
- **Model Training**: You can further train the loaded model and apply additional callbacks as needed.

## Training the Model
### Steps
1. **Download Dataset**: Download the dataset from the provided link: [Dataset Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nLwmRSAGseFITBUGG83JikS4k5hOMb_4?usp=drive_link).
2. **Data Directory**: Create a data directory inside the `src` folder.
3. **Place Dataset**: Place the downloaded dataset in the data directory.
